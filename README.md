# RevenueForecasting
A notebook try to predict the revenue for hotels based on data in real life (real data)

In France, there is a diverse range of hotels spread across various regions, catering to the needs of travelers and tourists alike. Within these hotels, there exist sub hotels or smaller lodging establishments that operate under the main hotel brand. The primary objective is to forecast the monthly revenue generated by each sub hotel to optimize financial planning and resource allocation.

To achieve this, we can employ data-driven approaches such as machine learning and statistical models that take into account factors like seasonal trends, location, sub hotel size, and customer demographics. By analyzing historical data and leveraging real-time information, we can develop predictive models that enable accurate revenue estimation for each sub hotel on a monthly basis.
